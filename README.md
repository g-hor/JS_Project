# State Stats
## Background
United Stats of America is a choropleth map tool that presents the user with various mental health statistics by state for the U.S.A. Even with prior knowledge of statistics, interpretation of the figures and values is still hindered by technical jargon. This is a tool that is designed to demystify mental health concerns and spread awareness about serious issues that affect as much as one in four people. 


## Functionality & MVPs
In United Stats of America, users will be able to:

* view affected populations of mental health statistics through color schemes
* select different categories mental health statistics
* view a selected state's raw population count for the selected condition and a proportional (percent) value for the selected condition
* zoom in and view state-specific data by clicking on individual states


In addition, this project will include:

* Definitive and conceptual context to explain the practical significance of different statistics
* A production README
