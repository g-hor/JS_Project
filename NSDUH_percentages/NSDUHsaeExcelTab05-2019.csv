"Table 5. First Use of Marijuana, by Age Group and State: Average Annual Initiation Estimates (Expressed as Percentages of the At-Risk Population) Based on 2018 and 2019 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Average annual initiation of marijuana (%) = 100 * {[X1 ÷ (0.5 * X1 + X2)] ÷ 2}, where X1 is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months and X2 is the number of individuals who never used marijuana (with the at-risk population defined as 0.5 * X1 + X2). Both of the computation components, X1 and X2, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach. The age group shown is based on a respondent's age at the time of the interview, not his or her age at first use. For details, see Section B of the “2018-2019 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology” at https://www.samhsa.gov/data/.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The state and census region Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals presented here use a simultaneous solution for the First Use of Marijuana and Never Used Marijuana outcomes, which had age group-specific random effects that were allowed to be correlated across the two outcomes. The associated Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains were used to calculate the posterior variance. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
