"Table 33. Attempted Suicide in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2018 and 2019 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Respondents were asked whether they attempted suicide in the past 12 months only if they had serious thoughts of suicide in the past 12 months. Respondents who had no suicide thoughts were categorized as not attempting suicide in the past 12 months.,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,
