"Table 27. Any Mental Illness in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2018 and 2019 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder, other than a developmental or substance use disorder, as assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition—Research Version—Axis I Disorders (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). As such, these estimates are based on indicators of AMI rather than direct measures of diagnostic status. For details, see Section B of the ""2018-2019 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology"" at https://www.samhsa.gov/data/.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,
